# Color Meaning Checker 🎨✨

A simple Java console application that allows users to input a color name and receive a meaningful description or personality trait associated with that color.  
This project was created as part of my MotionCut Internship (Week 2 Project).  

---

## 🚀 Features
- Accepts color names: **red, blue, green, yellow, black, white**
- Case-insensitive input (`RED`, `red`, `ReD` all work)
- Gives meaningful description with emojis 🎭
- Loops until the user types **exit**
- Simple and beginner-friendly

---

## 🖥️ Example Run
```
🎨 Welcome to Color Meaning Checker!
Enter a color name (red, blue, green, yellow, black, white).
Type 'exit' to quit.

Enter a color: red
❤️ Red → Passion, Energy, Confidence

Enter a color: green
💚 Green → Growth, Balance, Harmony

Enter a color: purple
❌ Sorry, I don’t have a meaning for that color.

Enter a color: exit
👋 Goodbye! Thanks for using Color Meaning Checker.
```
